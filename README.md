# SpamFilter
• Developed a spam email filter using machine learning models, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM and kNN
• Trained and Tested ML models on public dataset with 1000 emails and with a train-test ratio of 9:1
• Preprocessed and cleaned datasets using sophisticated techniques like Word stemming, Lemmatization and Normalization
• Used 3000 most frequent words and thereby created features matrix and data dictionary to train and test all ML models with
highest accuracy of 97.69% by Naïve Bayes
